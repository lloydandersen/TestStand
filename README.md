## Intro

Teststand is a collection of numerical solvers for space vehicle and mission design. The bank of functions allows quick solutions or the rapid creation of new specialized tools.  

## Toolkit

The toolkit is a collection of packages and modules that allow for the rocket scientist.

- Engine Designer

- Launch Vehicle Designer

- Mission Design

- Colony Expasnion Simulation

- Space Base Desginer
  
- Launch Panels


## Manifesto

TestStand is for the future explorer, engineer, and dreamer. The “rocket scientist” job title has been relegated to the annals of history and rejected by those in the professional fields. It has been made into a simile by the English language. But the work of the rocket scientist has not ended. Rocket science is needed now more than ever before. A century of writers, scientists, and engineers have left a footnote in their faded digitalized documents. It most of them, though not explicitly–hope. 

The age of grand government programs and military expansions into space are but abated. Which I would argue is not necessarily a terrible thing. I prefer not being blasted by a space laser and my suit combusting into flames. Nor do I care for the political maneuvering in any capital city. Space is decentralized now, its door can now be opened by anyone who knows the combination.

The institution and specialization of the job of the rocket scientists have led to the loss of the grand picture. We have material engineers, turbopump technicians, and impeller specialists. They do their job and are enforced into their caste. No longer is the age of the propulsion specialist or more generally the rocket scientist. One pushing the boundaries of what could be engineered. Rather than clicking the time box and focusing on some extremely specific hardware. When we focus on the tree, we do miss the forest. The elk and bear. The salmon and fly. A bigger system of great complexity that no human yet fully understands. That is the nature of TestStand. We have equations and data. Now we have open tools for anyone who wants to make the single step–Do so.
